     <p>This super creamy and refreshing mango smoothie is the ultimate summertime smoothie, just perfect to cool you down on a hot summer day.</p>
     <p>It is super simple to make. Just toss all your ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth and your deliciously creamy mango smoothie will be ready just in a minute.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul type="circle">
     <li>3 Cups Frozen Mangoes</li>
     <li>1 Large Frozen Banana</li>
     <li>1/2 Cup Milk (Dairy Or Dairy-free)</li>
     <li>1/2 Cup Greek Yogurt (Dairy Or Dairy-free)</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Instructions</h2>
     <ul type="circle">
         <li>Place the milk, frozen mangoes, frozen banana, and greek yogurt into your blender (always remember to add your liquid first into the blender, that will help your blender to run a little more smoothly).</li>
         <li>Blend until completely smooth and creamy.</li>
         <li>Pour into 2 large glasses, garnish with some mint leaves, pop in a straw and serve.</li>

     <p>You can use fresh mangoes and banana instead of frozen, just add a handful of ice cubes to your blender in that case. So the smoothie will still be nice and thick and cold.</p>
